# React Skill Brushup

## Purpose

This is a simple React application with trivial UI / UX exercise examples. These exercises are meant to help me brush up on thinking and executing within React

## Sources

Exercises are either copied or derived from sources found online. Sources such as the React Beta docs, Algo/Frontend Churn, Twitter examples, etc. I will try to give credit to the source of the feature with inline comments where possible
